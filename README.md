# C Programming Practice Projects

A collection of mini C programs created to practice and strengthen fundamental programming concepts. This repository is actively maintained and continuously updated as new concepts are learned and practiced.

## 📚 Learning Journey

This repo documents my learning progress with small, focused programs that practice key C fundamentals:
- ✅ Loops and iteration
- ✅ Conditionals and decision-making
- ✅ Functions and modularity
- ✅ Arrays and data structures
- ⚠️ File handling and I/O
- ✅ Random number generation
- ✅ User input validation
- ✅ Basic algorithms
